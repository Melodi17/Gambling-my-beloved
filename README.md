# Gambling my beloved

## Todo
- Company competition based on industry
- Betting on company failure
- Recent stocks banner
- Better transaction screen
- Transaction history
- Optimize performance [50%]
- Fix share prices and percentages syncing on the index page
- Add dashboard page to show portfolio, recent transactions, and yields
- Market manipulation (buying alot of shares to increase price and selling to decrease)
- Fix 0 shares but investment in brackets is visible
- Fix company industries enum array
- Fix total investment calculation
  - i think the problem with the total investment is that, they dont cancel eachother out?
    e.g you buy one, then sell it for a different price, theres some leftover :3
